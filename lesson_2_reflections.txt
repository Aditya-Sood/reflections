What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Creates a hidden .git directory to store all the metadata about the repository.

	Required to create a Git repository which can now be used to keep track of the files in repository.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	It is the intermediate between the two, where files corresponding to a single commit are brought together before being bunched into a single commit.

	Allows you to bunch files corresponding to a particular commit together.



How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	The staging area allows you to pick and choose files whose updates are to be bundled together as a
	single commit. So even if you've made more than one logical change to the files in the working
	directory, the staging area allows you to selectively pick the ones for each individual commit.
